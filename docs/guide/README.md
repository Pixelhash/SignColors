# Guide ‚§¥Ô∏è

This guide take you through the initial setup (installation) of the plugin.

## Installation

### Server Setup

If you haven't already, head over to [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and download Spigot's BuildTools.
Put them into a folder of your choice and compile the JAR for your future server.

Visit the [Spigot Wiki](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) for more information or help.

### Server Start

Start the server at least once, so the `plugins` directory is created.
Stop the server after it has finished loading/generating.

### Download SignColors

::: warning
Make sure to download the correct version of the plugin, fitting the version of the server!
:::

Download the plugin's JAR file [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/signcolors.6135/).
Put it into the `plugins` directory of the server.

### Server Start #2

Start the server again and - after finishing loading - you should find a `SignColors` folder in the `plugins` directory.

### Configure

You can now configure the plugin to your liking by modifying the `config.yml`.
Don't forget to either reload the plugin or restart server.
